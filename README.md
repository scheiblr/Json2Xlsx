# Json2Xlsx

This small framework allows to export 1:n data from sql and show them in one xlsx file. Therefore, we offer some loader functions as well as some formatting tools.

This php package keeps very simple and is intended to visualize more complex data structures with the possibility to not display redundant data.

## Requirements

This package was tested and developed under PHP7 with the following extensions activated:

    - php_zip
    - php_xml
    - php_gd2
    
Maybe it will work with PHP>=5.6, but we did not test this.
